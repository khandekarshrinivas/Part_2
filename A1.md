**Link to application:** [https://www.lastpass.com] (https://www.lastpass.com)

LastPass is a password management application that stores encrypted passwords in private accounts. LastPass is cross-platform i.e. along with a mobile application, it has browser extension, which allows managing our passwords while we are working on browsers.

## Why LastPass? 
Nowadays having a strong and secure password is very difficult to remember and citing a password in sticky notes or saving it as a draft in your messenger is prone to a security breach. So, it is necessary for a user to manage their sensitive data like usernames and passwords. LastPass allows us to store the credentials for various accounts in more secure and reliable fashion.

## Why someone should go with LastPass?
LastPass manages and simplifies our online life from remembering passwords for us. With this app, we can have very strong, and unique passwords matching all the criteria’s and having a strong strength and proving its effectiveness against brute force attacks. Having such strong, distinct and peculiar passwords for various logins is very tedious and difficult to remember. To facilitate life all from these, one should use a Secure and Smart Password Manager application – LastPass

## Technologies leveraged in LastPass:
LastPass comes with strong password management system. [3]
* Algorithms for strong password encryption-
*	All passwords are stored in cloud, to ensure security for the data in the cloud it uses AES-256-bit encryption with PBKDF2 SHA-256 and salted hashes
*	Encryption at device level- 
*	All the passwords, your data, your master lock or keys are never sent to or are accessible to LastPass servers.
*	Two-Factor Authentication-
*	Before authorizing access to a user, it adds extra security to your account with Two-factor Authentication, also referred to as 2FA

## Type of Application:
LastPass is a Productivity application - it offers many services to the user like managing and securing password, generating passwords, filling profile forms, auto-filling login forms, etc.


## LastPass Strengths and Weaknesses:

**Strengths:-**

* Serves as Secure and Handy Password Storage in your pockets.
*	Using few taps, you can log in to other apps.
*	Mitigates user responsibilities while logging into websites in browsers.
*	Leverages Mobile’s fingerprint function to unlock & provide additional security.
*	Offers share and auto sync password feature. 
*	Emergency Access to the designated contact.
*	Serves as Inhouse for your credit card details. 

**Weakness:-**

* Lacks guarantee service when compatibility is concerned.
*	Lacks assistance when downloading the attachments in their integrated web browsers.

## Scope of improvement:-

*  It should provide support for downloads in their integrated web browsers.
* Should provide compatibility with all apps and should be cross platform. 


## First Heuristic Evaluation: Visibility of system status
LastPass has very good visibility when it comes to showing the user what exactly is going on in the system.  While changing master lock password in LastPass, I came through Password Strength Indicator which turns from Red to Green as the strength of the password increases. Another scenario, which made me list this visibility of system status is that, while opening the Facebook application from my LastPass, it gave proper indications what the system is going through, from logging-in to logging-off from Facebook account.

## Second Heuristic Evaluation: Match between system and real world
I strongly agree that LastPass application has a reliable and user-friendly interface, which helps us to set up the application, create LastPass account and set up the application master lock easily.
It also supports various languages like English, Dutch, French, Hindi, Italian, Chinese, etc., which will make us more convenient and familiar to use. 

## Third Heuristic Evaluation: Help and Documentation
Below is an example of how fine LastPass - user manual is, It helps us to access the frequently asked questions, steps to get started with, how to begin installing and setting up the account, and there are many other categories wherein a user can explore and learn about the application.
Even though LastPass has a very good help and supports team, which acknowledges each query raised by the user. A new user can easily step up the application by going through their documentation. LastPass documentation can be translated into various languages like English, German, Italian, Hindi, etc. depending upon the user.

# Second Application: Parallel Space - Multiple accounts & Two face
**Link to application:** [http://parallel-app.com]
(http://parallel-app.com)

Parallel Space is an application where user can create a separate space on your mobile device to manage multiple applications like WhatsApp, Facebook, Gmail, or any other gaming application. It allows users to leverage multiple computer functionality and replicate apps and use them. 

## Why Parallel Space?
I use multiple accounts like WhatsApp and Gmail, both were intended for separate use. And it's very tedious and it's not handy to carry two devices and use these applications on them. Parallel Space enables me to do so on a single device by creating a Virtual Operating System on the original operating system. It gives me a convenient environment to use all these features on a single device.

## Why someone should go with Parallel Space?
This application has a good feature of creating a separate independent VM on your android without disturbing the functionality of actual operating system. Some cellphones have an option of second space, but it is completely different from Parallel Space. Parallel Space application acts an Virtual Space, and it doesn’t navigate you to a different space, like Second Space does.

## Technologies leveraged in Parallel Space:-
 Parallel Space uses MultiDroid, short for “Multi Android”- an advanced technology of virtualization engine that supports individual mobile computing platforms, enables Parallel Space to create an independent virtual operating system, which is completely separated from the user original operating system on any android device.

## Type of Application:-
Parallel Space is Productivity Application.

## LastPass Strengths and Weaknesses:- 

**Strengths :-** 

* Its robust, safe and easy-to-use mobile application.
*	Provides effective transitions while switching between multiple accounts.
*	Allows multiple accounts at the same time on one device.
*	With Incognito Installation feature, makes apps invisible ands secures the user privacy.
*	Supports 24 languages, and compatible with most of the Android apps.

**Weaknesses:-**

*	It does not support staying online on the two accounts simultaneously.
*	It consumes a lot of battery power
*	Compatibility issues with some apps.

**Scope of improvement:-**

*	Battery consumption should be minimized
*	Application Load time in Parallel Space should be addressed for faster speed and better performance.
*	Compatibility issued should be resolved.
*	Should notify users, even when they are not active on parallel space.


## First Heuristic Evaluation: User Control and Freedom
While replicating applications in my parallel space, I observed that If I add an application accidentally to my virtual space, then I need not worry and be tensed about it. Parallel space has a very good user control and I was able to delete the added replica of the application easily from my parallel space application without disturbing or losing the data from my actual application on the original operating system.

## Second Heuristic Evaluation: Error Prevention
A better design for an application comes with a confirmation before performing any actions. I noticed that Error preventions are taken care of Parallel Space. When deleting replicas from your Parallel Space, it might delete the application data. Thus to prevent this accidental actions, it prompts for a confirmation saying - “deleting this app will also delete all its data”.

## Third Heuristic Evaluation: Aesthetic and minimalist design
The design of Parallel space comes with only relevant features, where every piece of information displayed on their User Interfaces (UI) is basic, minimal and essential. Being a new user of this application, I found this app to be very easy and simple to use, as it does not contain any unnecessary and confound elements or information on their UI.
